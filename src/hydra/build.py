    '''
    Basic class that represents a Build, which is essentially a list
    of build steps to be executed. 
    
    Parallelization is controlled by each step's parentStepName parameter.
    Steps are executed in parallel as long as each step's parent is not a 
    currently running step. If a build step is reached whose parent is a 
    currently running step, the build sequence halts until that step has 
    finished executing.
